# CP77-HideGripAndInjection

![](preview.png)

## About

This mod allows to toggle the Weapon Grip and/or Injection Mark conditionally at runtime.

There's already a bunch of mods that do this through archive files by removing textures/meshes.
However, you're required to restart your game if you change your mind.
Moreover, this mod is also able to toggle the Weapon Grip within the inventory screen and photo mode.

You'll also be able to disable them based on current clothing which may fix some clipping.

### Requirements

- [CET 1.37.0+](https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks)
